            The year is 1938. Joseph Joestar, the brash and cunning grandson of Jonathan Joestar, takes the stage. Unlike his noble and reserved grandfather, Joseph is quick-witted, irreverent, and delights in provoking his enemies, yet beneath the humor lies sharp intellect and unshakable bravery.

Joseph’s carefree life in New York ends when Speedwagon, now a wealthy oil magnate, discovers an ancient stone pillar in Mexico. Within sleeps a “Pillar Man” — a member of the ancient race that created the Stone Mask. Awakened by Nazi experimentation, the Pillar Men — Santana, Wham, Esidisi, and their leader Kars — seek the Red Stone of Aja. Combined with the Stone Mask, the gem grants them ultimate power and immunity to sunlight.

After defeating Santana, Joseph teams up with the proud Ripple user Caesar Zeppeli and trains under the strict guidance of Lisa Lisa. Together they battle across Europe, but tragedy strikes when Caesar falls heroically, entrusting his mission to Joseph.

In the final battle, Kars uses the Red Stone to become the “Ultimate Life Form,” achieving perfect evolution. Outmatched, Joseph tricks Kars into a volcanic eruption, launching him into space, where he freezes and drifts for eternity. Believed dead, Joseph later shocks everyone by appearing at his own funeral. The Pillar Men’s threat is over, but Dio’s shadow still looms, hinting that the Joestar family’s fight has only begun.        </p>

                Joseph Joestar is the protagonist of JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure: Battle Tendency, the second part of the series. As the grandson of Jonathan Joestar, he inherits the family’s courage and sense of justice, but unlike his noble and reserved grandfather, Joseph is witty, irreverent, and fond of outsmarting his foes. Though playful on the surface, he shows unwavering responsibility and sacrifice when it matters most.

Joseph’s primary ability is the Ripple (Hamon), a life energy produced through controlled breathing, capable of combating supernatural threats such as the Pillar Men. Under the strict training of Lisa Lisa, he joins forces with Caesar Zeppeli to battle Kars, Esidisi, and Wham, who seek the Red Stone of Aja. After Caesar’s tragic death, Joseph confronts the “Ultimate Life Form” Kars, defeating him through cunning and courage by casting him into space for eternity. His victory not only saves the world but also continues the Joestar family’s fateful legacy.
